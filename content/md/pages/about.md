This blog is a collection of my various thoughts on software (and perhaps other topics). No real theme, just whatever has popped into my head or piqued my interest at the time. As I learn and grow as a developer, my ideas and preferences change, and it might be interesting to have a historical record of that journey. Maybe there's a useful nugget or two in it for you, too.
